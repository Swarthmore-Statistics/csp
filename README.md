# Statistical Learning in R
# CSP 2018

Materials for the Statistical Learning in R short course at CSP 2018 will be posted here.  

Participants who want to follow along in their own R session should download the following R packages before the tutorial:

`dplyr, ggplot2, knitr, glmnet, broom, caret, GGally, readr, splines, SemiPar, kernlab, rpart, partykit`.  

If you have trouble downloading `caret` (or another package), that is okay.  We will make it work!  For `caret`, the first answer in this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46174574/caret-package-failed-to-install) proved successful for my research students.
